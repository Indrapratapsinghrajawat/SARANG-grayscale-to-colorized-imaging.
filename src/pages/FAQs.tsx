    question: "What is SAR image colorization?",
    answer:
      "SAR image colorization is the process of adding meaningful color information to grayscale Synthetic Aperture Radar images. Unlike arbitrary colorization, scientific SAR colorization uses deep learning to assign colors based on radar backscatter properties, terrain characteristics, and contextual understanding from training data.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is this different from SAR-to-optical translation?",
    answer:
      "SAR colorization adds color while preserving radar-specific features like speckle, shadows, and texture. SAR-to-optical translation attempts to simulate what an optical sensor would capture, often losing radar-unique information and introducing domain-shift artifacts. Our approach maintains scientific validity while improving visual interpretability.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is scientific information preserved during colorization?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Our SAR-RANG model is specifically designed to preserve radar-specific information. We use IHS fusion for ground truth generation (keeping original SAR intensity) and evaluate using metrics like SAM (Spectral Angle Mapper) that measure information preservation alongside visual quality metrics.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are the real-world applications?",
    answer:
      "Colorized SAR images are valuable for: (1) Disaster monitoring - faster assessment of floods, landslides, and earthquakes; (2) Environmental analysis - tracking deforestation, soil erosion, and agricultural changes; (3) Defense surveillance - improved situational awareness for terrain analysis and movement detection; (4) Research - making SAR data accessible to non-radar experts.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why use Conditional GANs for this task?",
    answer:
      "Conditional GANs (specifically Pix2Pix) are ideal because they learn a mapping conditioned on input images. The generator produces colorized outputs while the discriminator ensures realistic local textures. This adversarial training produces sharper, more coherent results than traditional regression approaches.",
  },
  {
    question: "What makes SAR imagery special?",
    answer:
      "SAR uses active radar pulses to image the Earth, providing: (1) All-weather capability - radar penetrates clouds and light rain; (2) Day-and-night operation - doesn't need sunlight; (3) Unique information - surface texture, moisture content, and structure. This makes SAR irreplaceable for continuous monitoring.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is the model evaluated?",
    answer:
      "We use multiple complementary metrics: Q4 (quaternion-based quality assessment for multi-channel images), NRMSE (normalized root mean square error for pixel-level accuracy), and SAM (spectral angle mapper for measuring spectral fidelity). This multi-metric approach ensures both visual quality and scientific accuracy.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use this for my own SAR images?",
    answer:
      "This is currently an academic research project demonstrating the feasibility and methodology of CGAN-based SAR colorization. While the model architecture and approach are documented, deployment for production use would require additional validation and potentially retraining on specific SAR sensor data.",
